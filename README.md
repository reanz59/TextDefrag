# TextDefrag
Text extracted from documents sometimes consists of word fragments.

For example: "ISOâ€™s por t fo l io of over 18 500* standards provides business, government and society with practical tools
for a l l three dimensions of sustainable development: economic, env ironmental and socia l."

This project provides two ways of handling fragmented text: ASCII, or UNICODE. For development of defragmenting just use the defragment.lisp code.

Alternatively, in addition to defragment.lisp, use the systems.lisp to use UNICODE code-points.
