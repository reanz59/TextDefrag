<p>ISO has a membership of 163* national 
standards bodies f rom countr ies large and 
smal l,  industr ia l ized, developing and in tran-
si t ion, in a l l  regions of the wor ld. 
</p>
<p>ISO’s por t fo l io of over 18 500* standards 
provides business, government and society 
with practical tools for a l l  three dimensions 
of sustainable development: economic, en-
v ironmental and socia l.
</p>
<p>ISO standards make a posit ive contr ibution 
to the wor ld we l ive in. They faci l i tate trade, 
spread knowledge, disseminate innovative 
advances in technology, and share good 
management and conformity assessment 
practices.
</p>
<p>ISO standards provide solutions and 
achieve benef i ts for a lmost a l l  sectors of 
activ i ty, including agr iculture, construction, 
mechanical engineer ing, manufactur ing, 
</p>
<p>distr ibution, transpor t, medical devices, in-
formation and communication technologies, 
the environment, energy, qual i ty manage-
ment, conformity assessment and serv ices.
</p>
<p>ISO only develops standards for which there 
is a clear market requirement. The work is 
carr ied out by exper ts in the subject drawn 
directly f rom the industr ia l,  technical and 
business sectors that have identi f ied the 
need for the standard, and which subse-
quently put the standard to use. These 
exper ts may be jo ined by others with re le-
vant knowledge, such as representatives of 
government agencies, testing laborator ies, 
consumer associations and academia, and 
by international governmental and nongov-
ernmental organizations.
</p>
<p>An ISO International Standard represents a 
global consensus on the state of the ar t in 
the subject of that standard.

About the ISO Technical Management Board Process Evaluation Group (PEG)
</p>
<p>In  recent years,  to be respons ive to both 
cur rent and new stakeholder needs and to 
mainta in i tse l f  as a h igh ly re levant Interna-
t iona l  Standards deve loper,  ISO has seen 
i ts  work programme expand and evo lve 
into new subject  areas.  Compel l ing cha l-
lenges for  ISO regard ing i ts  standards 
deve lopment processes have come wi th 
th is evo lut ion,  as stakeholder expectat ions 
of  the ISO system are changing.
</p>
<p>As a resu l t,  the ISO Technica l  Management 
Board ( ISO/ TMB) has formed i ts Process 
Eva luat ion Group (PEG) to invest igate 
the respons iveness of  the ISO standards 
deve lopment processes to these changing 
dynamics.  The u l t imate intent of  the PEG’s 
ef for ts is  to safeguard the outcomes of 
the ISO system and to promote the ex ist-
ing va lue,  strength and author i t y  of  In-
te rnat iona l  Standards and the processes 
by which they are produced. Indeed, the 
ISO/ TMB agreed that the PEG, in i ts  work, 
must uphold the commitment of  the ISO 
system to par t ic ipat ion v ia nat iona l  stand-
ards bodies (NSBs),  as we l l  as through the 
cons iderat ion of  the input rece ived f rom 
l ia ison organ izat ions.
</p>
<p>Essentia l ly the PEG has two main tasks :
</p>
<p>Task 1
•	 To rev iew the current s i tuat ion and 
</p>
<p>consider the possibi l i t y of a l ternat ive 
models1) of  standards development op-
erat ions and par t ic ipat ion in ISO2). 
</p>
<p>Task 2
•	 To examine processes for consensus 
</p>
<p>decis ion-making and stakeholder en-
gagement with in nat ional standards 
bodies (NSBs) and l ia ison organizat ions, 
which may impact the credibi l i t y of re-
sul t ing ISO standards3).   
</p>
<p>Please note that th is document is a resul t 
of the PEG’s pursui t  of Task 2 above.

<p>Section 2
ISO/TMB PEG Task 2 – Why is it important ? Why is it being pursued ?
</p>
<p>Any discussion of the rat ionale for PEG 
Task 2 must begin by recogniz ing the fo l-
lowing impor tant statements made in ISO 
governance documents :
</p>
<p>“ ISO members are commit ted to deve lop-
ing g lobal ly re levant Internat ional Standards 
by...  Organiz ing nat ional input in a t imely 
and ef fect ive manner, tak ing into account 
a l l  re levant interests at nat ional leve l...”
</p>
<p>“ ISO par t ies are commit ted to...  Communi-
cat ing in a fa i r  and transparent manner to 
interested par t ies when work on new stand-
ards is in i t iated and subsequent ly on the 
progress of the i r  deve lopment...”
</p>
<p>From the ISO Code of  Ethics ,  2004
</p>
<p>“For the ISO work in which they choose to 
par t ic ipate, ISO members are expected to 
organize nat ional consul tat ion mechanisms, 
according to the i r nat ional needs and pos-
s ib i l i t ies, which prepare nat ional posi t ions 
that ref lect a balance of the i r  countr y’s 
nat ional interests...”
</p>
<p>From the List  of  Fundamental  Pr inciples 
of  the ISO System ,  1999
</p>
<p>“...Nat ional bodies have the responsibi l i t y 
of ensur ing that the i r  technical standpoint 
is establ ished tak ing account of a l l  inter-
ests concerned at nat ional leve l...”
</p>
<p>From the ISO/IEC Direct ives,  Part  1 , 
Foreword,  I tem C on Discipl ine
</p>
<p>In addit ion, ISO/IEC Guide 59:1994, Code 
of good pract ice for standardizat ion,  states 
the fo l lowing under c lause 6.3 :
</p>
<p>“At internat ional leve l,  nat ional par t ic ipat ion 
in the standardizat ion process is organized 
under the auspices of the appropr iate na-
t ional standards body which is the member 
of the re levant internat ional standards or-
ganizat ion. Nat ional members shal l  ensure 
that the i r  par t ic ipat ion ref lects a balance 
of nat ional interests in the subject mat ter 
to which the internat ional standardizat ion 
act iv i ty re lates.”
</p>
<p>General ly,  ISO processes and national body 
engagement have been v iewed as success-
fu l  to resul t  in ISO standards ref lect ing a 
double leve l of consensus – among market 
players and exper ts at the draf t ing stages 
of the standards, and among countr ies at 
the formal vot ing stages of the standards.
</p>
<p>However, recent ly with in some ISO 
act iv i t ies there have been some con-
cerns expressed regarding the integ-
r i t y of ISO nat ional body processes for 
stakeholder engagement and consen-
sus decis ion making. The credib i l i t y 
of these nat ional processes is v i ta l  to 
ensure the credib i l i t y of the resul t ing 
ISO standards and, u l t imately,  of the 
ISO brand in the marketplace. I t  is im-
por tant to recognize that the ISO standards 
development process is one that is col lec-
t ive ly owned and implemented by ISO and 
i ts members in accordance with broadly 
accepted pr incip les and guidance.
</p>
<p>I t  is impor tant to consider that internat ional 
and some broadly based regional organiza-
t ions a lso make act ive contr ibut ions to the 
development of ISO standards as recog-
nized l ia isons. Therefore,  i f  the credib i l i t y 
of internal processes of nat ional bod-
ies has an impact on the credib i l i t y </p>

</p>
<p>of ISO standards and ISO i tsel f,  then 
in pr incip le,  the same is t rue for the 
internal processes of organizat ions in 
l ia ison and their input .
</p>
<p>I t  i s  for  th is reason that  the PEG has 
dec ided to seek input f rom ISO nat iona l 
bodies and l ia ison organ izat ions on the i r 
inte rna l  processes for  stakeholder engage-
ment and consensus dec is ion mak ing. The 
process for  co l lect ing input and summar y 
obser vat ions of  that  input is  deta i led in 
Annex A to th is document.  Through con-
s iderat ion of  th is input,  the PEG has deve l-
oped the pr inc ip les and gu idance present-
ed in Sect ion 3 of  th is document.
</p>
<p>The W TO Commit tee on Technica l  Bar r ie rs 
to Trade has estab l ished cer ta in pr inc i -
p les for  the deve lopment of  internat iona l 
standards that  should be obser ved when 
internat iona l  standards,  gu ides and rec-
ommendat ions are e laborated, to ensure 
transparency,  openness,  impar t ia l i t y  and 
consensus, ef fect iveness and re levance, 
coherence, and to address the concerns 
of  deve lop ing countr ies.  The cor rect  refe r-
ence for  the W TO/ TBT document prov id ing 
these pr inc ip les is  Decis ions and Recom-
mendat ions Adopted by the WTO Commit-
tee on Technica l  Bar r ie rs to Trade s ince 1 
Januar y 1995, Annex B. G/TBT/1/Rev.9,  8 
September 2008.  These pr inc ip les,  espe-
c ia l l y  in re lat ion to t ransparency,  open-
ness,  impar t ia l i t y  and consensus, commu-
n icate impor tant ideas that,  i f  implemented 
by standards bodies,  contr ibute to the 
cred ib i l i t y  of  the interna l  processes of  ISO 
nat iona l  standards bodies and internat ion-
a l  l ia ison organ izat ions.  Therefore,  these 
ideas have been incorporated in the de-
ve lopment of  the pr inc ip les and gu idance 
presented in Sect ion 3 of  th is document.
</p>
<p>One of  the un ique strengths of  the ISO 
system is the d ivers i t y  that  ex ists among 
NSBs and l ia ison organ izat ions.  Such d i-
vers i t y  is  seen not just  in geographic loca-
t ion,  number of  staf f  or  annua l  budgets of 
the NSBs or l ia ison organ izat ions,  but a lso 
in the ar ray of  approaches they employ 
that  may be su i tab le to suppor t  the i r  en-
gagement in ISO standards deve lopment. 
</p>
<p>Di f ferences in approach may occur for 
many reasons, and may be based on di f fer-
ing organizat ion operat ional models, stake-
holder dynamics or avai lable resources. 
Embracing and shar ing the range of ef fec-

speci f ic expectat ions on a l l  par t ies may in-

</p>
<p>Within the documents developed for th is

</p>
<p>Section 3
Principles and guidance on stakeholder engagement  
and consensus decision-making for ISO liaison organizations
</p>
<p>3.1 Stakeholder engagement  
for new ISO projects
</p>
<p>This sect ion prov ides pr incip les and guid-
ance to enable ISO NSBs to assess the ir 
leve l of interest in, and suppor t for, new 
work proposed in ISO that does not re-
late to ex ist ing ISO commit tees and in the 
absence of an ex ist ing and re levant NSB 
national commit tee.
</p>
<p>Principles
3.1P1 For new ISO projects, the proposer 
</p>
<p>of the init iat ive should indicate the 
range of organizations/stakeholder 
groups supporting the init iat ive, 
as well as those that, according to 
their interests and identif ied needs 
should as a minimum be involved in 
its development in order to faci l i tate 
the arrangements of national 
consensus bui lding.
</p>
<p>3.1P2 The range of relevant national 
stakeholders to be engaged wil l 
depend on the ISO subject and wil l 
vary from one subject to another.
</p>
<p>3.1P3 ISO NSBs should be committed 
to informing and seeking input 
from a broad range of relevant 
national stakeholders on any 
new ISO projects when they are 
proposed.
</p>
<p>3.1P4 All relevant national stakeholders 
should be given equal access to 
information and equal opportunity to 
provide input.
</p>
<p>3.1P5 Information on new ISO projects 
should be provided to the national 
stakeholders in a timely manner 
and at the earliest appropriate 
opportunity to allow all relevant 
national stakeholders to access the 
information, determine their interest in 
</p>
<p>it and provide input effectively by any 
deadlines.
</p>
<p>3.1P6 ISO NSBs should make provision for 
a range of approaches to support 
t imely and effective stakeholder 
engagement and participation based 
on the needs of the stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.1P7 ISO NSBs should seek input 
that represents organizational 
perspectives (e.g., companies, 
organizations, trade associations, 
government agencies, consumer 
interest groups, etc.) and/or the 
perspective of individual experts.
</p>
<p>3.1P8 ISO NSBs should be committed 
to base decisions on whether to 
support the proposed new work 
and their level of involvement 
in the ISO activity (P or O) on 
consideration of the collected 
input received from relevant 
national stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.1P9 Comments submitted by NSBs 
should ref lect the national 
consensus rather than a compilation 
of al l  comments expressed at 
the national level. Submittal of 
redundant or even contradictory 
comments should be avoided.
</p>
<p>Guidance
To assist in achiev ing these pr incip les, the 
fo l lowing guidance may be he lpfu l  :
</p>
<p>3.1G1 ISO members should conduct a 
national consultation with all relevant 
stakeholders. This could take place 
via a step-wise approach such as :
</p>
<p>a) Identif ication of potential stake-
holders – In addition to any in-
ternal processes, adver tisements 
and general meetings, NSBs are 
encouraged to seek input on po-
tential ly relevant stakeholder from </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>
</p><p>9Engaging stakeholders for ISO national standards bodies
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>trade organizations, other organi-
zations, governmental agencies, 
user/consumer groups that can 
complement the NSBs knowledge. 
This is especial ly the case in a 
new f ield for standardization
</p>
<p>b) Providing stakeholders with infor-
mation on the project proposal
</p>
<p>c) Collecting feedback from stake-
holders regarding whether there is 
a need for the proposed Interna-
tional Standard(s). This could be 
done via postal or e-mail input, or 
by conducting a workshop or an 
in-person meeting, teleconference 
or Web-based discussion of the 
proposed International Standard(s)
</p>
<p>d) Identifying those stakeholders wil l-
ing to par ticipate in the new ISO 
work on an ongoing basis. 
</p>
<p>3.1G2 Once relevant stakeholders have 
been engaged in the process 
and have contributed views 
and comments on the proposal, 
based on the input received, 
the responsible individual 
within the NSB should develop 
a recommended response for 
review and endorsement as the 
NSB position and comments on 
the ISO proposal.
</p>
<p>3.1G3 There are many ways of engaging 
with the relevant stakeholders, 
both proactively and passively. For 
example, i f your organization has 
a Website, detai ls of the proposal 
should be placed on the site and 
a more targeted identif ication can 
be made via notices in relevant 
publications, on-l ine news items to 
stimulate discussion, and through 
already established sectors within 
NSBs. Furthermore, active outreach 
and communications to identif ied 
stakeholders should be pursued. 
Stakeholders in need of funding to 
support their part icipation should 
seek out sources of such funding.
</p>
<p>3.1G4 NSBs new to active engagement in 
the ISO system may wish to seek 
advice and best practices from other 
NSBs who have had substantial 
experience to date.
</p>
<p>3.2 Stakeholder engagement  
and consensus decision-
making on ISO work
</p>
<p>This sect ion prov ides pr incip les and guid-
ance to suppor t the ef for ts by NSBs re lated 
to stakeholder engagement and consensus 
decis ion-making in the development of na-
t ional posi t ions on ISO work on an ongoing 
basis.
</p>
<p>Principles
3.2P1 The approach by which an NSB 
</p>
<p>determines its national position is 
the decision of the NSB.
</p>
<p>3.2P2 NSBs should establ ish an 
appropr iate process to 
develop nat ional  posi t ions and 
comments on ISO work,  as 
wel l  as to determine the NSBs’ 
representat ion at  ISO meet ings. 
I t  is  recommended that nat ional 
mir ror  committees (NMCs) are 
formed whenever possib le,  but 
some NSBs may determine the i r 
nat ional  posi t ions by other means.
</p>
<p>3.2P3 Some NSBs may a l ready have 
nat ional  committees in a f ie ld 
where new internat ional  pro jects 
are started and the NSB should 
use th is ex ist ing nat ional 
committee in a capaci ty as an 
NMC i f  i t  is  interested in serv ing in 
such a capaci ty and able to fu l f i l l 
the requirements of  such a ro le. 
</p>
<p>3.2P4 Differences in approach may be 
based on differing operational 
models, national dynamics or 
available resources. Regardless of 
the specific approach used, what 
is vital is that the development of 
the national position is informed 
by, and responsive to, the input 
collected from the relevant national 
stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.2P5 A descr ipt ion of  how the NSB 
determines i ts  nat ional  posi t ions 
should be publ ic ly  ava i lab le to 
a l l  nat ional  stakeholders or  made 
avai lable to them upon request.
</p>
<p>3.2P6 I t  is  the responsib i l i ty  of  the NSB 
to arr ive at  a nat ional  posi t ion </p>

</p>
<p>that  ref lects and reconci les the 
v iews of  the range of  i ts  nat ional 
stakeholders that  have a leg i t imate 
interest  in the ISO subject .
</p>
<p>3.2P7 At t imes the development of  a 
nat ional  posi t ion may require 
considerat ion of  stakeholders’ 
interests in other re lated nat ional 
mir ror  committees.
</p>
<p>3.2P8 Decis ions with in NSBs should be 
taken based on the consensus 
pr inc ip le and such decis ions 
should carefu l ly  consider the 
balance of  interests across the 
input col lected f rom re levant 
nat ional  stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.2P9 All relevant national stakeholders 
should have equal access to 
participation in the NSB’s process 
for development of national 
positions, and all national 
stakeholders formally engaged 
in the NSB’s process should be 
assured of fair and equitable 
treatment and consideration in that 
process.
</p>
<p>3.2P10 Al l  re levant nat ional  stakeholders 
and NSB procedures must be 
committed to the development of 
a nat ional  posi t ion that  ref lects 
consensus across mult ip le 
stakeholders and stakeholder 
categor ies.
</p>
<p>3.2P11 When consensus is  reached among 
stakeholders wi th in an NSB on 
technica l  content issues and on a 
nat ional  posi t ion on ISO work,  i t  is 
expected that  the NSB wi l l  submit 
the stakeholder consensus posi t ion 
and technica l  comments to ISO in 
accordance with i ts  establ ished 
procedures.  I t  is  recognized that 
on occasion an NSB may need 
to make edi tor ia l  rev is ions for 
pol i t ica l  or  legal  reasons.
</p>
<p>3.2P12 Comments submit ted by NSBs 
should ref lect  the nat ional 
consensus rather than a 
compi lat ion of  a l l  comments 
expressed at  the nat ional  leve l . 
Submit ta l  of  redundant or  even 
contradictory comments should be 
avoided.
</p>
<p>3.2P13 When consensus is  reached with in 
an NSB on a nat ional  posi t ion on 
ISO work,  a l l  re levant nat ional 
stakeholders should respect and 
support  that  nat ional  consensus 
posi t ion with in ISO act iv i t ies and 
at  ISO meet ings,  and they should 
not express v iews with in the ISO 
act iv i ty  that  may l imi t  the success 
of  the nat ional  consensus posi t ion.
</p>
<p>3.2P14 Where consensus cannot be 
reached and a fundamenta l 
object ion cannot be overcome, i t 
is  important that  the NSB have a 
procedure for  d ispute resolut ion or 
appeals. 
</p>
<p>3.2P15 I f  a l l  e ffor ts to achieve consensus 
on a nat ional  posi t ion fa i l  and 
where there is  therefore no 
agreement on a nat ional  posi t ion, 
a posi t ion of  abstent ion should be 
submit ted to ISO.
</p>
<p>3.2P16 A P-member of  an ISO committee 
should represent broad nat ional 
interest . 
</p>
<p>3.2P17 I f  an ISO member is  request ing P 
membership of  a committee,  an 
NMC or equiva lent  process should 
be in p lace to determine a nat ional 
consensus posi t ion.
</p>
<p>3.2P18 If there is very limited national 
interest (e.g. one or a very small 
number of stakeholders) in 
the standardization area, it is 
recommended that Observing O 
membership should be sought. 
An NSB may seek Participating 
P membership in the ISO activity 
provided that the limited level of 
interest represents the existing and 
relevant national stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.2P19 ISO committees and the i r  leaders, 
NSBs and l ia ison organizat ions and 
the i r  de legates and experts should 
respect the consensus posi t ions 
submit ted by NSBs and l ia isons. 
SBs with concerns regarding 
the credib i l i ty  of  another NSB’s 
consensus posi t ion,  based on the 
process to develop that  posi t ion, 
should pursue the i r  concerns v ia 
d i rect  b i latera l  d ia logue between 
the concerned NSBs.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>
</p><p>11Engaging stakeholders for ISO national standards bodies
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>3.2P20 NSBs should per iodica l ly  assess 
the i r  processes and procedures 
for  stakeholder engagement and 
consensus-decis ion making on 
ISO work,  and seek to cont inual ly 
improve them as necessary.
</p>
<p>Guidance
To assist in achieving these principles, the fol-
lowing guidance may be helpful :
</p>
<p>3.2G1 Consensus is defined in the ISO/
IEC Directives, Part 1 as: “General 
agreement, characterized by the 
absence of sustained opposit ion to 
substantial issues by any important 
part of the concerned interests 
and by a process that involves 
seeking to take into account the 
views of al l  part ies concerned 
and to reconcile any confl ict ing 
arguments. Consensus need not 
imply unanimity.”
</p>
<p>3.2G2 In practice, consensus has its origins 
in the desire to achieve the general 
acceptance and application of a 
standard within its intended sphere 
of inf luence. This entai ls trying to 
ensure that the interests of al l  those 
l ikely to be affected by it are taken 
into account and that the individual 
concerns are careful ly and fair ly 
balanced against the wider public 
interest.
</p>
<p>3.2G3 Achievement of consensus entails 
recognizing the wider interest 
and sometimes making certain 
compromises. Arguments for and 
against the existence of an ISO 
project should be pursued at the 
stage where the project proposal 
is considered and action is taken 
on it. However, once an ISO project 
has been approved, all NSBs and 
stakeholders involved in the process 
should be committed to advancing 
the global relevance of International 
Standard(s) within the agreed-upon 
scope, and they should not seek 
to hinder its further development. 
Where a member sustains a 
fundamental objection and supports 
it with sound arguments, these 
concerns will be taken seriously.
</p>
<p>3.2G4 NSBs have an obligation to address, 
and make an effort to resolve, al l 
views expressed. 
</p>
<p>3.2G5 When establishing national 
posit ions on International Standards 
((committee drafts (CD), draft 
International standards (DIS), f inal 
draft International Standards (FDIS)) 
etc.) i t is good practice for the NSB 
to identify for its own records the 
range of stakeholders that have been 
involved in the national decision-
making process. ISO processes 
and voting questions at al l  stages 
(proposal, CD, DIS, FDIS) should 
remind NSBs that they should be 
conducting broad stakeholder 
consultations in the development of 
posit ions and comments, and ask 
them to verify that they are doing so.
</p>
<p>3.2G6 When a national posit ion has been 
established, it is good practice 
for the NSB to communicate this 
national posit ion to al l  relevant 
stakeholders that have been 
engaged in its development.
</p>
<p>3.2G7 The procedure to appeal NSB 
decisions should, as a f irst step, 
promote informal and open dialogue 
between the concerned parties 
to attempt to resolve confl icts via 
informal rather than formal means 
whenever possible. 
</p>
<p>3.2G8 Any formal appeal process should 
be fair and transparent and include 
provisions to ensure that the 
decision-makers are perceived by 
the concerned parties as being 
neutral on the issue in question.
</p>
<p>3.2G9 NSBs may organize national 
meetings, teleconferences or Web-
based discussions to assist in the 
development of national posit ions. 
Al l relevant stakeholders should have 
an opportunity to participate.
</p>
<p>3.2G10 Again, as under Item 3.1G4 above, 
NSBs new to active engagement in 
the ISO system may wish to seek 
advice and best practices from other 
NSBs who have had substantial 
experience to date</p>

</p>
<p>3.3 National participation at 
ISO standards development 
meetings
</p>
<p>This section provides pr inciples and guid-
ance on selecting and prepar ing (1) national 
delegation members to at tend meetings 
of ISO technical commit tees (TCs), project 
commit tees (PCs) and subcommit tees (SCs), 
and (2) national exper ts to at tend ISO work-
ing group meetings.
</p>
<p>Principles
3.3P1 National delegations and national 
</p>
<p>experts are appointed by the NSB.
</p>
<p>3.3P2 The identif ication of NSB 
delegations and experts should 
occur within an NMC, or by 
equivalent means, within the NSB.
</p>
<p>3.3P3 All relevant and interested 
stakeholders who are members 
of the NMC should be afforded 
fair and equitable consideration 
to serve as an NSB delegate or 
expert.
</p>
<p>3.3P4 The NSB delegation should be 
able to represent al l  aspects of 
the agreed national posit ion. This 
might entai l  having more than one 
delegate attend the ISO meeting.
</p>
<p>3.3P5 All members of an NSB 
delegation to an ISO TC/PC/SC 
meeting should be expected to 
speak with one voice to advocate 
for the NSB’s national position.
</p>
<p>3.3P6 National experts to an ISO WG 
should be selected on the basis of 
their relevant technical expertise.
</p>
<p>Guidance
To assist in achiev ing these pr incip les, the 
fo l lowing guidance may be he lpfu l  :
</p>
<p>3.3G1 National delegat ions should be 
selected from the members of the 
NMC and be act ively engaged in the 
work of the NMC. 
</p>
<p>3.3G2 The select ion cr i ter ia may be based 
on a number of factors, for example 
technical expert ise, effect ive 
communicat ion ski l ls in language of 
</p>
<p>meet ing, and act ive part ic ipat ion in 
the work of the NMC.
</p>
<p>3.3G3 National experts should be selected 
and nominated through the NMC. 
Though selected for their individual 
technical knowledge and expertise, 
such experts should be aware 
of national posit ions in order to 
minimise confl ict as the project 
progresses. WG experts should 
regularly report to their NSB or NMC 
on the progress of work within the 
WG.
</p>
<p>3.3G4 I t is preferable that appointed 
individuals from national delegations 
and national experts be in a posit ion 
to commit the necessary t ime and 
resources.
</p>
<p>3.3G5 Continuity of part icipation in national 
delegations and as WG experts 
throughout the l i fe-cycle of an ISO 
project should be preferred and 
encouraged.
</p>
<p>3.3G6 All national delegation members or 
WG experts with a financial need 
should have fair and equitable 
access to, and consideration for, 
such funding from any source. It 
should not be assumed that the 
NSBs themselves will be able in all 
cases to provide such funding. Any 
source for such funding, should 
have procedures established for 
the administration of the funding 
program, the application process to 
acquire the funding and the criteria 
for approving requests for the 
funding. These procedures should 
be open, transparent and available 
to any relevant party for the fund.
</p>
<p>3.3G7 National delegations should select 
a head of the delegation. If another 
delegate can speak to an issue 
more effectively than the head of 
delegation, the head of delegation 
should seek to be recognized to 
speak and then request the other 
delegate to speak for him or her.
</p>
<p>3.3G8 Members of national delegations and 
WG experts should have suff icient 
language ski l ls to effectively 
communicate in the environment of 
the particular ISO committee or WG.</p>

</p>
<p>3.3G9 Preparation of national delegations and 
national experts before meetings should 
include :
</p>
<p>a) A br ief ing by the NMC on national 
posi t ions (th is may occur v ia a 
physica l meeting, a te leconference 
or a Web-based discussion)
</p>
<p>b) Formal or informal tra in ing on ISO 
rules and procedures (e.g. ISO/IEC 
Direct ives)
</p>
<p>c)  Access to documentat ion, meeting 
minutes and any papers that are 
re levant to the technical subject 
and meeting.
</p>
<p>3.3G10 National delegations and national 
experts should maintain close 
communication, which should include 
a debrief ing by the national delegation 
members or national experts to the 
NSB or NMC fol lowing the international 
meeting.
</p>
<p>3.3G11 NSBs and NMCs should very careful ly 
consider whether they should al low one 
or a very small number of delegates 
from a single organization to represent 
the NSB at an ISO meeting when 
the organization(s) may be the only 
interested stakeholder within the NSB. 
</p>
<p>3.3G12 If new business is raised for action at 
the meeting that was not appropriately 
communicated to the committee in 
advance of the meeting, the national 
delegation should seek that such 
action be deferred until effective 
national consultations of all NSBs that 
are P members can take place.
</p>
<p>3.3G13 NSBs and/or their NMCs should 
provide their delegates and experts 
with guidance concerning how much 
negotiating f lexibi l i ty they have 
regarding the national consensus 
posit ion and comments at an ISO TC, 
SC or WG meeting. In addit ion, the 
NSB and/or its NMC should advise 
the delegates and experts as to their 
posit ions and negotiating f lexibi l i ty in 
relation to posit ions and comments of 
other NSBs.

<p>3.4 Establishment and operations  
of national mirror committees
</p>
<p>This sect ion prov ides pr incip les and guidance 
to NSBs on NMCs to ISO work, for NSBs that 
choose to use an NMC approach.
</p>
<p>Principles
3.4P1 Internal procedures for the 
</p>
<p>establishment and operations of 
NMCs should exist and should be 
publicly available.
</p>
<p>3.4P2 For those NSBs who form NMCs, 
an NMC should be establ ished as 
ear ly as possible in the process to 
ensure that the NSB is in a posit ion to 
respond to the ISO process.
</p>
<p>3.4P3 Some NSBs may already have nat ional 
committees in a f ie ld where new 
internat ional projects are started 
and the NSB should use this exist ing 
nat ional committee in a capacity as 
an NMC i f  i t  is interested in serving in 
such a capacity and able to ful f i l l  the 
requirements of such a role.
</p>
<p>3.4P4 The NSB should make every effort 
to identify the relevant stakeholders 
that should be engaged in the NMC 
and those stakeholders that the NSB 
has been engaged with early in the 
process, should be contacted at this 
stage to ensure continuity.
</p>
<p>3.4P5 The composit ion of the NMC 
should demonstrate part ic ipat ion of 
representat ive organizat ions across 
the relevant stakeholders with a 
legit imate interest in the ISO subject.
</p>
<p>3.4P6 Al l  members of the NMC should have 
equal part ic ipat ion r ights and equal 
access to relevant information.
</p>
<p>3.4P7 Attempts should be made to 
achieve balance with respect to the 
composition of the NMC. Procedures 
should exist to safeguard against 
dominance by any stakeholder or 
stakeholder category.
</p>
<p>3.4P8 Once the mirror committee has been 
establ ished, the composit ion of 
the committee should be reviewed 
regular ly and addit ional stakeholders 
may be invited to part ic ipate </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>
</p><p>14 Engaging stakeholders for ISO national standards bodies
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>throughout the l i fe-cycle of the ISO 
work.
</p>
<p>3.4P9 NSBs should provide suitable 
information, advice or training on ISO 
standardizat ion to al l  members of the 
NMC.
</p>
<p>3.4P10 The NMC’s formation should be 
approved by the NSB, for example 
by senior management or by a 
governance group made up of relevant 
stakeholders.
</p>
<p>3.4P11 NMCs should maintain records of their 
decis ions.
</p>
<p>Guidance
To assist in achiev ing these pr incip les, the fo l-
lowing guidance may be he lpfu l  :
</p>
<p>3.4G1  Relevant stakeholders to be contacted 
and invited to participate wil l  depend 
on the subject matter of the ISO 
activity. Examples of how this may be 
approached may include enquir ies, 
Internet searches, networks, personal 
approaches, advertisements, etc.
</p>
<p>3.4G2 For NSB senior management or 
a governance group made up of 
relevant stakeholders to approve the 
establishment of the NMC, the fol lowing 
information should be provided: 
</p>
<p>a) Background and just i f icat ion for the 
ISO activ i t y;
</p>
<p>b) Scope of the proposed ISO activ i t y 
</p>
<p>c) Proposed NMC membership 
</p>
<p>d) A c lear statement for the leve l of 
par t ic ipat ion (P or O) in the ISO 
activ i t y
</p>
<p>e) A work programme or business plan 
of the ISO activ i t y
</p>
<p>f )  A commitment of suf f ic ient resourc-
es in place in order to establ ish and 
operate the NMC. 
</p>
<p>3.4G3  For the purposes of openness and 
transparency, the procedure for the 
establishment of a NMC should be 
made publicly avai lable (e.g. through 
the NSB Website, presentations, 
experts communicating within the 
community, etc.)
</p>
<p>3.4G4 NMC members should be encouraged 
to develop their knowledge of 
</p>
<p>standardization operations and 
procedures. This could be achieved 
via introductory information packages, 
training and education sessions, 
mentoring programs, IT tools, etc.
</p>
<p>3.4G5  The consensus development process 
of NSBs and NMCs should be open 
to all who are directly and materially 
affected by the standardization 
activity in question. Any stakeholder 
may contribute via public review and 
comment without joining the NMC if 
it wishes, but it is the responsibility 
of the NMC to develop the national 
consensus positions. This includes an 
obligation to consider input received 
from the public review and comment. 
There should be no undue financial 
barriers to participation. If a fee for 
participation is charged, then it should 
be reasonable and fair. A fee waiver 
or fee reduction option is encouraged. 
Where potential funding sources 
for participating (underrepresented) 
stakeholders are known, such 
information should be made available 
as appropriate.
</p>
<p>3.5 Leadership of national  
mirror committees
</p>
<p>This sect ion prov ides pr incip les and guidance 
for NSBs on the se lect ion, qual i f icat ions and 
tra in ing of NMC Chairs and NMC secretar ies, 
for NSBs that choose to use an NMC ap-
proach.
</p>
<p>Principles
3.5P1 The se lect ion of  the chai r  and 
</p>
<p>secretary of  a new NMC should 
take p lace as soon as possib le af ter 
the establ ishment of  the new ISO 
committee and decis ion is  taken to 
establ ish a new NMC.
</p>
<p>3.5P2 Once the establishment of the NMC 
is approved, the NSB or a governance 
group of relevant stakeholders may 
assign the secretariat role for the 
NMC to an internal staff member 
or outsource the secretariat role 
to an external organization. Where 
the secretariat role for the NMC is 
outsourced, an agreement should </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>
</p><p>15Engaging stakeholders for ISO national standards bodies
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>be signed between the NSB and the 
external organization, and there 
should be ongoing monitoring by the 
NSB, to ensure good performance. 
</p>
<p>3.5P3 NMC chairs are se lected on the basis 
of  the i r  chai r ing abi l i t ies,  wi l l ingness 
and avai labi l i ty  to be committed for 
the durat ion of  a pro ject ,  subject-
matter  knowledge and understanding 
of  ISO. Where possib le,  chai rs 
should be se lected f rom amongst the 
members of  the NMC.
</p>
<p>3.5P4 NMC secretar ies are se lected on 
the basis of  the i r  knowledge of  ISO 
ru les and procedures,  ava i lab i l i ty  of 
adequate resources to manage the 
NMC and wi l l ingness to be committed 
for  the durat ion of  a pro ject .
</p>
<p>3.5P5 The NMC chair  and secretary have 
the pr imary responsib i l i ty  to act  in a 
neutra l  manner to fac i l i tate the NMC’s 
decis ion-making and to ensure: 
that  a l l  re levant stakeholders on the 
NMC have fa i r  and equi table access 
to in format ion,  that  they have an 
opportuni ty to prov ide input,  and that 
considerat ion of  the i r  input is  g iven 
in the development of  the nat ional 
posi t ion.
</p>
<p>Guidance
To assist in achiev ing these pr incip les, the fo l-
lowing guidance may be he lpfu l:
</p>
<p>3.5G1 The selection process for NMC chairs 
and secretaries is a very important 
part in establ ishing an effective NMC. 
For this reason, steps should be 
taken to ensure that the selection is 
highly informed, e.g. by clearly placing 
the issue on the agenda of the f irst 
meeting.
</p>
<p>3.5G2  NMC chairs and secretaries are 
appointed by the NSB, in some cases 
on the basis of a nomination and 
approval process within the NMC.
</p>
<p>3.5G3  Effective chairing abilities are the most 
important skills for an NMC chair. 
These abilities include managing the 
NMC’s decision-making processes, 
effectively resolving disagreements, 
guiding the NMC to consensus, and 
managing meetings and discussions 
</p>
<p>that cross stakeholder categories 
and perspectives. Training for NMC 
chairs should, inter alia, focus on the 
enhancement of these skills.
</p>
<p>3.5G4 Extensive knowledge of ISO rules and 
procedures are the most important 
skills for NMC secretaries. This 
includes knowledge of the ISO/
IEC Directives, the ability to use the 
required IT tools and good drafting 
skills. Training for secretaries should, 
inter alia, focus on the enhancement of 
these skills. 
</p>
<p>3.5G5  Training for both chairs and secretaries 
can be provided through any number 
of means such as manuals, seminars, 
workshops, training courses, and 
individual advice upon request. This 
also includes ensuring that the NMC is 
well informed regarding the expected 
duties of chairs and secretaries.
</p>
<p>3.5G6 I t may be useful for the NSB to 
faci l i tate information exchanges among 
chairs and secretaries across al l  of the 
NSB’s NMCs, to promote the sharing 
of experiences and good practices. 
This can be done via seminars and 
workshops or via onl ine tools.
</p>
<p>3.5G7 NSBs have a responsibi l i ty to ensure 
that chairs and secretaries are aware 
of their roles and responsibi l i t ies both 
national ly and international ly. 
</p>
<p>3.5G8 NSBs should also ensure that they 
regularly update chairs and secretaries 
on any developments or changes (e.g. 
ISO/IEC Directives )  that may impact the 
work of the NMC.</p>

<p>Annex A
PEG Task 2 – Input collection methodology and summary observations
</p>
<p>To col lect input for considerat ion to pro-
duce Sect ion 3 of th is document,  the ISO 
Secretar y-Genera l  issued a let ter to a l l  ISO 
fu l l  members, inv i t ing them to submit the i r 
input on a ser ies of quest ions v ia an onl ine 
sur vey too l.  Of the approx imate ly 100 ISO 
fu l l  members that rece ived th is inv i tat ion, 
responses were rece ived f rom 41. This was 
regarded as a ver y good sur vey response, 
and in par t icu lar,  i t  should be noted that 
the responses showed a ver y good distr i -
but ion of deve loped and deve loping coun-
tr ies, as wel l  as geographic d ivers i t y.
</p>
<p>The numbered i tems presented be low rep-
resent the quest ions asked of ISO nat iona l 
bodies, and fo l lowing each quest ion are 
the PEG’s summary obser vat ions on the re-
sponses rece ived.
</p>
<p>1) In i t iat ion of new ISO work
</p>
<p>1.1) When ISO embarks on a new f ie ld of 
standardizat ion, and in the absence 
of a re levant nat iona l  commit tee, how 
does your NSB assess the leve l  of 
interest,  in and suppor t for,  th is ISO 
act iv i t y in your countr y ?
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
A number of good pract ices were ident i f ied 
with in the responses – a lmost a l l  conduct 
some form of stakeholder engagement to 
assess the leve l of interest wi th in the i r 
countr y. A few l imi t the i r  consul tat ions to 
an assessment by staf f  wi th in the i r respec-
t ive organizat ions. 
</p>
<p>2) Establ ishment of ISO nat ional  
mirror commit tees
</p>
<p>2.1) Do you have an interna l  procedure 
for the establ ishment of nat iona l  mir-
ror commit tees to ISO act iv i t ies ?
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
For ty of 41 respondents have such a proce-
dure. 
</p>
<p>2.2) I f  yes, p lease prov ide deta i ls of  the 
procedure.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
A few procedures were ident i f ied with in 
the responses. Some chose not to go into 
deta i l  of the procedure but advised that 
a commit tee is establ ished, i f  re levant. In 
a number of the responses, i t  is apparent 
that the nat ional commit tee is considered 
i f  the nat ional body is approached by an 
ex ternal par ty as opposed to a proact ive 
approach by the nat ional body to ident i f y 
and create. Some respondents do not have 
any (or many) nat ional mir ror commit tees.
</p>
<p>2.3) Please adv ise i f,  and how, th is proce-
dure is made publ ic ly ava i lab le.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
I t  appears that in the major i ty of cases, the 
procedures are made publ ic ly avai lable. 
Where the procedure is not publ ic ly avai l-
able, a l l  those involved in the deve lopment 
of standardizat ion appear to be provided 
with the deta i ls.
</p>
<p>3) Mirror commit tee membership
</p>
<p>3.1) How do you ident i f y stakeholder 
groups and ensure ba lance of par t ic-
ipat ion in your mir ror commit tees ?
</p>
<p>3.2) How do you determine which stake-
holders wi l l  be invo lved
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Stakeholder ident i f icat ion is centra l  to the 
establ ishment of consensus posi t ions, 
but there are few speci f ic procedures 
surrounding how to do th is act iv i ty and 
few procedures regarding the balance of </p>

</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>par t ic ipat ion were provided in the responses 
to quest ion 3.1. Responses to quest ion 3.2 in-
d icated that there are a lso d i f fe rences among 
the respondents regarding the type of stake-
holders that are contacted to par t ic ipate. 
</p>
<p>3.3) Do your procedures a l low for new mem-
bers to jo in the mir ror commit tee at any 
t ime ?
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
For ty of the 41 responses indicated that new 
stakeholders may jo in the i r mir ror commit tees 
at any t ime. 
</p>
<p>3.4) Please descr ibe any specia l  resources 
or approaches that suppor t the par t ic i-
pat ion of persons in par t icu lar stake-
holder groups in the mir ror commit tee.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Responses on th is quest ion represented a 
broad spectrum of input. Some NSBs re-
sponded that they provide specia l  suppor t 
e i ther in the form of tra in ing and or ientat ion of 
de legates and exper ts or in the form of fund-
ing to suppor t par t ic ipat ion in the mir ror com-
mit tee. Other NSBs indicated that they provide 
no specia l  suppor t.
</p>
<p>3.5) How do you address the composi t ion of 
mir ror commit tees in cases where there 
is l imi ted but strong interest in your 
countr y in the outcome of an Interna-
t iona l  Standard ? 
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
A number of NSBs responded that they have 
no specia l  procedures to address th is issue. 
Others indicated i t  would be unl ike ly that a 
mir ror commit tee would be formed and un-
l ike ly the NSB would take act ive par t ic ipat ion 
in an ISO act iv i ty i f  the interest is so l imi ted. 
St i l l  others indicated that they would conduct 
fur ther outreach to seek more interest to par-
t ic ipate, or they would tr y to proceed as much 
as possible wi th the l imi ted interest they have. 
</p>
<p>4) Addressing dif fer ing ISO technical 
subjects in mirror commit tees 
</p>
<p>4.1) Do you approach the establ ishment and 
membership of the mir ror commit tee 
d i f fe rent ly dependent upon the subject 
area and the par t ic ipat ion leve l  (P, O, 
etc.)  ?
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Four teen respondents indicated that they 
handle establ ishment and membership of mir-
ror commit tees based on subject or leve l of 
par t ic ipat ion, and 25 respondents indicated 
that they do not.
</p>
<p>4.2) I f  yes, p lease prov ide deta i ls.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Some responded that the process for estab-
l ishing mirror commit tees is always the same, 
but the members or stakeholder groups may 
be di f ferent depending on the subject. Some 
respondents indicated di f fer ing approaches in 
re lat ion to O (observer) membership, and some 
indicated that, in the case of O membership, 
they may not form mirror commit tees at al l.
</p>
<p>5) Decision-making  
in mirror commit tees
</p>
<p>5.1) Please descr ibe how you take decis ions 
(e.g.,  by consensus, by vot ing, requi re-
ments to take decis ions) in your mir ror 
commit tees. 
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
The major i ty of responses indicated that 
decis ions are taken in accordance with the 
consensus pr incip le, whi le some NSB mirror 
commit tees have numer ic vot ing procedures 
to be implemented when consensus may be in 
quest ion.
</p>
<p>5.2) Please descr ibe what happens wi th in 
your mir ror commit tees i f  agreement 
cannot be reached on a decis ion.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
A var iety of responses were provided, in-
c luding absta in ing when consensus is not 
reached, inst i tut ing a numer ic vot ing proce-
dure i f  consensus is not reached or c lear, and 
in some cases, referr ing the f ina l  decis ion on 
the NSB posi t ion to a staf f  person of the NSB 
senior management. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div class="page"><p>
</p><p>19Engaging stakeholders for ISO national standards bodies
</p>
<p>a
</p>
<p>5.3) Please descr ibe any mechanism in 
p lace for appeals of decis ions taken by 
mir ror commit tees.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Most NSB responses indicated that the i r  na-
t ional mir ror commit tee procedures conta in 
provis ions for handl ing appeals. Others indi-
cated that they had no such procedure but 
that the nat ional mir ror commit tee would con-
t inue to d iscuss the i tem unt i l  i t  was resolved. 
A lmost a l l  responses indicated that appeals 
are referred to the parent group of the body 
that took the act ion be ing appealed. This can 
ex tend up to governance bodies of the NSB. 
One respondent indicated that i t  handles ap-
peals as i t  would customer compla ints under 
an ISO 9001 qual i ty management system. 
</p>
<p>6) Par t ic ipat ion at ISO standards  
development meet ings
</p>
<p>6.1) Please descr ibe how you se lect and ap-
prove your nat iona l  de legat ion members 
to meet ings of ISO TCs, PCs and SCs, 
and your nat iona l  exper ts to ISO WGs.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
In a lmost a l l  responses, the nat ional mir ror 
commit tee decides on the members of the na-
t ional de legat ion or the exper ts f rom the NSB 
who at tend ISO meet ings.
</p>
<p>6.2) Please descr ibe how you prepare your 
nat iona l  de legat ion members to meet-
ings of ISO TCs, PCs, SCs.
</p>
<p>6.3) Please descr ibe how you prepare your 
nat iona l  exper ts to meet ings of ISO 
WGs.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
In response to quest ions 6.2 and 6.3, most 
NSBs responded that they provide a l l  ap-
propr iate ISO commit tee or WG documenta-
t ion to the de legates and/or exper ts and hold 
nat ional meet ings in advance of ISO meet ings 
to d iscuss issues and determine posi t ions 
and comments to be carr ied forward to the 
meet ing. Some NSBs also provide specia l ized 
tra in ing programs and or ientat ion sessions to 
prepare de legates and exper ts.
</p>
<p>6.4) Please descr ibe any specia l  resources 
or approaches that suppor t the par t ic i-
</p>
<p>pat ion of persons in par t icu lar stake-
holder groups in the internat iona l  com-
mit tee meet ings.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
In genera l,  responses to th is quest ion were 
s imi lar to the responses provided to quest ion 
3.4 above.
</p>
<p>7) Mirror commit tee leadership
</p>
<p>7.1) Please descr ibe any procedure you 
have for the se lect ion and appointment 
of mir ror commit tee cha i rs and secre-
tar ies.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
In genera l,  most responses indicated that the 
mir ror commit tee chairs are se lected by the 
mir ror commit tee membership based on con-
siderat ions such as: leadership sk i l ls,  consen-
sus-bui ld ing, capabi l i t y and exper t knowledge 
of the subject of the ISO commit tee. Gener-
a l ly,  secretar ies of mir ror commit tees are as-
s igned these ro les by the management of the 
NSB, or the management of an ex ternal or-
ganizat ion administer ing the mir ror commit tee 
on behal f  of the NSB. 
</p>
<p>7.2) Please descr ibe any procedures you 
have for the qual i f icat ions and respon-
s ib i l i t ies of mir ror commit tee cha i rs and 
secretar ies.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
Many respondants indicated that the i r  mir ror 
commit tee procedures conta in deta i ls on the 
qual i f icat ions and responsibi l i t ies of mir ror 
commit tee chairs and secretar ies.
</p>
<p>7.3) Please descr ibe any programmes or ac-
t iv i t ies you have for tra in ing or prepara-
t ion of mir ror commit tee leadership.
</p>
<p>Summary observat ions :
A number of respondents indicated that they 
provide or ientat ion sessions and specia l ized 
tra in ing courses for mir ror commit tee leaders. 
Some NSBs also organize regular conferences 
of mir ror commit tee chairs and secretar ies 
that provide good oppor tuni t ies to network, 
d iscuss issues of common concern and share 
good pract ices.</p>
